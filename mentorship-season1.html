					<p>Some of our external third parties are based outside of the European Economic Area (<b>EEA</b>) or the United Kingdom (<b>UK</b>). For example, some participants of the mentorship scheme might be outside of the EEA or the UK.</p>
					<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data outside of the EEA or the UK, we may transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission or by the United Kingdom. For further details, see:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>For transfers outside of the EEA, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en">European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries (link to external website)</a>.</li>
						<li>For transfers outside of the UK, <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/international-transfers-after-uk-exit/#adequacy">Information Commissioner’s Office: International Transfers and adequacy regulations (link to external website).</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>We may also transfer your data to other countries that are not considered adequate by the EEA and/or the UK. <b>The information below is important. Read it carefully.</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>The recipients of your personal data will be the people you are matched with for the mentorship scheme.</li>
						<li>We will follow the points below if you are in the EEA or the UK and other participants are outside of the EEA or UK (respectively).</li>
						<li>Once you have been placed into a group, we will tell you which countries your personal data will be sent to. We will seek your explicit consent over Discord to do this.</li>
						<li>The data given to the participants will be your Discord username, your age, your discipline, the amount of time you want to spend on the scheme, your country of residence, your current experience, the biography about yourself, what you’re looking for from the scheme, and the messages that you send as part of the scheme.</li>
						<li>We need to make this transfer so that the scheme can work. If we do not make the transfer, then you will not be able to take part in the mentorship group you were placed in.</li>
						<li>You have a right to withdraw your consent at any time. If you do, we will ask those in your mentorship group to delete your data.</li>
						<li>If a transfer of your personal data is made to a country without adequate protection, we will not put in place any appropriate safeguards. Because there may not be a local supervisory authority and no (or only limited) individual data protection/privacy rights, this will create a risk to your privacy rights.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We will provide more information on the mechanism we use on a case-by-case basis.</p>
					<p>We will update our privacy notice as appropriate as the relationship between the EEA and UK evolves.</p>
