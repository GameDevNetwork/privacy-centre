					<h2>Purpose of this privacy centre</h2>
					<p>This privacy centre aims to give you information on how GDN collects and processes your personal data in different circumstances.</p>
					<p>Your personal data, or personal information, means any information about you where you can be identified. It does not include any data where we have removed your identity (anonymous data).</p>
					<p>We do not knowingly collect data on children under the age of 13.</p>
					<p>It is important that you read this privacy centre together with any other privacy notice or fair processing policy we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal data about you so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your data. This privacy centre supplements other notices and privacy policies. In the case of conflict between this privacy centre and another privacy notice, this notice shall apply.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Controllers</h2>
					<p>The following individuals make decisions together about your personal data, and are responsible for looking after it. Because of this, under the law they are known as "<b>joint controllers</b>".</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Liam Sorta (LiamSorta#0001)</li>
						<li>Joe Lancaster (acid#4517)</li>
						<li>Kim Koch (Minervia#7491)</li>

					</ul>
					<p>These people will be referred to as “<b>we</b>”, “<b>us</b>” or “<b>our</b>” in the privacy centre.</p>
					<p>Matthew Shipton is responsible for helping us follow our legal requirements. When carrying out this role, he is known as the “<b>Designated Controller</b>”. This responsibility is from Article 26 of the GDPR and UK GDPR. The Designated Controller is responsible for giving you the information you have the right to and letting you use your rights under data protection law. Each of us have agreed to work with the Designated Controller to meet our obligations under data protection law. You can still choose to use your rights under data protection law with any of us.</p>
					<p>We have put in place a non-binding agreement that describes each of our responsibilities. The Designated Controller is responsible for helping us meet the requirements under data protection law. This includes providing the information in this privacy centre. <a href="https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:d0659721-2b2d-40f9-969f-9df119452e71">You can read the full agreement here</a>.</p>

				<header><h1>Your legal rights</h1></header>
				<div>
					<p>Sometimes you will have rights from data protection law over your personal data. You can:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>request access to your personal data;</li>
						<li>request correction of your personal data;</li>
						<li>request erasure of your personal data;</li>
						<li>object to processing of your personal data;</li>
						<li>request restriction of your personal data;</li>
						<li>request transfer of your personal data;</li>
						<li>withdraw consent; and</li>
						<li>request not to be subject to automated decision making.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>No fee normally needed</h2>
					<p>You will not normally have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to use any of the other rights). But we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. We can also deny your request in these circumstances.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>What we need from you</h2>
					<p>We may need to ask for more information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure you can use your rights. This is a security measure to make sure your personal data is not given to anyone else. We may also ask for more information about your request, which can help speed up our response.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Time limit to respond</h2>
					<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will let you know and keep you updated.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>we get a complaint; or</li>
						<li>we reasonably think that there might be legal action about our relationship with you.</li>

					<p>We look at the following points when deciding how long we need to keep your data for:</p>

							<b>Legitimate Interest</b> means our interest in conducting and managing the GDN Discord Server or one of our activities, to enable us to give you the best and most secure experience.
							<ul>
								<li>We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights. We do this before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests.</li>
								<li>We do not normally use your personal data for activities where our interests are overriden by the impact on you. We might still use your data if we have your consent or if the law needs or allows us to.</li>
								<li>You can get further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you for specific activities by contacting us.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Third parties</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Internal Third Parties</b> are members of the GDN Discord Server that provide services on our behalf.</li>
						<li>
							We also use the following <b>External Third Parties</b>.
							<ul>
								<li>Discord (to the extent that they process data on our behalf) based in the United States of America, providing video, voice and messaging services online.</li>
								<li>Professional advisors acting as processors. For example, it includes lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers from the United Kingdom, Germany, or Sweden who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.</li>

				<div>
					<h2>Your legal rights</h2>
					<p>The law gives you some rights to control how we use your personal data.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							You can <b>request access</b> to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This allows you to get a copy of your personal data that we hold and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
						</li>
						<li>
							You can <b>request correction</b> of your personal data. This allows you to ask us to remove personal data if we do not have a good reason to continue processing it. You also have the right to ask us to remove your personal data where:
							<ul>
								<li>you have successfully used your right to object to processing (see below);</li>
								<li>we may have processed your information unlawfully; or</li>
								<li>we need to erase your personal data to comply with local law.</li>
							</ul>
							We may not always be able to follow your request of erasure for legal reasons. But if we can’t meet your request for legal reasons, we will let you know whenever we are allowed to.
						</li>
						<li>
							You can <b>object to processing</b> of your personal data if:
							<ul>
								<li>we are relying on our legitimate interest;</li>
								<li>we are relying on someone else’s legitimate interest; or</li>
								<li>we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.</li>
							</ul>
							You can only object to processing when we are relying on a legitimate interest if there is something about your own situation that you feel impacts your fundamental rights and freedoms. We may be able to show that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information. If we have a compelling legitimate ground, it will override your rights and freedoms.
						</li>
						<li>
							You can <b>request restriction of processing</b> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to pause our processing of your personal data:
							<ul>
								<li>if you want us to find out your data’s accuracy;</li>
								<li>where our use of your data is unlawful but you do not want us to remove it;</li>
								<li>where you want us to keep the data, even if we no longer need it, as you need to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or</li>
								<li>if you have objected to our use of your data but we need to check whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							You can <b>request the transfer</b> of your personal data to you or to someone else. We will give to you, or the person you choose, your personal data in a format that can be used easily. This is known as a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. This right only applies if:
							<ul>
								<li>you provided consent for us to use your personal data or we need to use your personal data for a contract; and</li>
								<li>we are processing your data through automated systems (so this excludes paper files).</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							You may <b>withdraw consent at any time</b> if you have previously given it. But withdrawing consent won’t affect whether we processed your data lawfully before that point. If you withdraw your consent, we may not always be able to continue providing access to the GDN Discord Server or our activities. If so, we will let you know when you withdraw your consent.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div>
